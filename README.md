# animated-win-background
Python script for animated backgrounds on Windows
<h1>Usage</h1>
After downloading the project:

1. Split animated image into frames. If the image is a GIF, use http://www.ezgif.com/split.
2. Delete images in <i>frames</i> folder of project (sample images).
3. Copy frames into <i>frames</i> folder of project.
4. Run <b>animate.py</b> (you will need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run this)
5. To stop the animation, close the script. 

NOTE: If you encounter performances issues, use less frames and/or increase the shuffle interval. To do this, change 0.15 to the amount of seconds you want in <b>animate.py</b>.

<h1>How it works</h1>
It's essentially an implementation of a background shuffler. The methods in <b>background_shuffler.py</b> simply change the background at a given time interval. By reducing this time interval to <1s, an animated background effect is achieved.
